## General Feedback
- Unless you need GZDoom-specific features, use a vanilla format to allow players who favor other ports to experience your map.

## MAP01
- Great architecture and use of textures!
- Layout seems to lend itself to deathmatch without compromising single-player progression. Awesome!
- The lowered area with imps in the first room feels strange. The layout draws the player into going down there, but the lack of detail and awkwardness of getting back out make it feel like something is missing.
- Favoring chaingun over shotgun as a starting weapon is an interesting choice. I like it!
- Consider adding stairs on the one-way drops flanking the imp area to improve flow.
- Instead of making doors flush with the wall, inset them just a little bit to increase the amount of detail and make them feel a little more polished.
- Great use of Spectre's in the dark room, but the strobing is a bit rough. Either use a slightly brighter dark level instead of pitch black or use the fading light instead of the strobing one.
- Leap of faith for the lava bridge is not intuitive. Since you can see the bridge easily from the sides it's not too bad, but maybe consider some other way of triggering it.
- Instant death lava pits is an interesting choice. Because they're pits and the player doesn't have to carefully navigate it, this actually works great! I wouldn't use GZDoom-specific functionality just for this though. If it is using that, I would replace it with vanilla-style pits (20-damaging floor, with or without making the bridges into escape lifts) unless there is something else that is driving the GZDoom exclusivity already.
- Great encounter design! Fights include a good mix of enemies that grants a little infighting potential, but doesn't forget to engage the player.
- Ammo availability feels a little tight.
- Weapon scaling could use a little work. Mostly skipping the shotgun and then jumping from the Chaingun straight to the Plasma Rifle feels jarring.
- (Not in video) If you fall into the water in the Plasma Rifle room, you can't get out.
- Saw some kind of scripting error `EV_MovePolyTo: Invalid PolyObj Num: 0` shortly after picking up the Plasma Rifle. Not sure what that was about. Didn't seem to affect gameplay.
- Detailing around level exit switch looks AWESOME!
- Make sure each area/room has something interesting to look at. Add light detailing on flat/plain walls.
- Map might not justify Blue Armor.
