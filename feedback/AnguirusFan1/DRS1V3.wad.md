## General Feedback
- You consistently are very good at timing the introduction of new weapons, availability of resources, and scaling the enemy difficulty. There aren't really any major difficulty spikes and I'm getting new weapons frequently enough that it stays interesting, but slow enough that it feels rewarding. Great job!

## MAP01
- Scattering health around and adding the rad suits definitely evened out the bumps in resource usage there. It plays much nicer now!
- I'm not sure the new hell area with the Pinky adds much - I personally think holding off on the hell areas until later in the map led to a better build-up - but that's pretty subjective. I could go either way.

## MAP02
- I LOVE the changes to the warehouse! It looks awesome and definitely feels like a spectacle reveal after the first half! Difficulty is perfect too!
- The chainsaw secret is great! It teases an area and the hidden door is clearly marked, but it's not obvious. Love it!
- I see a chaingun in the courtyard, but I couldn't find any way to get it.
- I'm still blown away by that elevator implementation! That goes double for the elevator in MAP03 where you can go up *and* down! Incredible! Maybe backport that to MAP02 so that the player can backtrack if they want to. Having it be a secret if you go down first is great too!

## MAP03
- This map is pretty cool. Great extension of the sewer area!
- The yellow key area is kind of strange. The super thin walls are confusing to look at. I would maybe redesign this.
- The arachnotron reveal is excellent!! As a minor point I would trigger it when you pick up the red key rather than when you open the yellow door, that way you're definitely going back there to progress rather than just potentially wandering around (if you didn't see the red key).
- The marines in the prison are a little strange. Thematically it's a really cool idea that you're freeing them, but then they just walk around and it's not clear what, if anything, you're supposed to do with them. The player doesn't want to kill them since they're friendly, but it also feels like you're forgetting something or leaving something unfinished if you leave them. Not sure what a good solution to that is, but something to think about.
- There's a door to the left of the blue key door that doesn't seem to ever open?
- There's a missing texture on the blue key elevator when you go up.
- Make sure to use an exit switch instead of making the exit door end the level directly.
