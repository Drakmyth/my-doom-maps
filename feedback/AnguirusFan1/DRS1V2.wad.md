## MAP01
- I always appreciate not having a hot start!
- Open up the outside areas a bit to allow the player to maneuver around.
- Sky heights cause corners and flat edges along tops of walls which looks strange. Either make the heights the same, or add ridges along the edges to give them some depth.
- Use ambush flag and sound-blocking linedefs to prevent all enemies in the area from waking up right away.
- Make sure to add colored trims or other indicators to doors that need keycards.
- Great decision to add new monsters to old areas you need to backtrack to!
- Make sure if the player needs to backtrack that they know they have a reason to do so. Locked doors or windows showing what change happened are good mechanisms for this.
- Visual design of the level generally looks pretty good, but some texture variation or additional detailing on the walls would be nice to break up the flatness and make it more lively. Different light levels could also be a huge contributor here.
- The islands in the lava hallway and blue key room are difficult to get back on if you fall off. Depending on how much of a platforming challenge you want this to be, making them larger would let the player move with more confidence (but get punished if they fall off) or making them lower would let the player easily climb back on if they do fall off.
- Show the player locked doors before bringing them to the key so they know what they need the key for.
- The stone throne room is visually interesting, but could use some kind of event to make it stand out.
- Scatter more health around. All the enemies are hitscan enemies, which will whittle away your health over time.
- The spiral stairway and hallway to the teleport is very cramped and hard to walk through. Maybe move it around to give some room to make it bigger.
- I LOVE LOVE LOVE the final city area!!! Texturing, detailing, and layout are great!
- Give the player some way to backtrack into the first part of the level in case they missed enemies or secrets that they want to get before finishing, or make it fairly obvious they are passing a point of no return.
- Generally avoid pass-through walls for secrets. Players don't expect to be able to walk through them, and if they can see there's nothing there they won't be inclined to investigate further.
- Having the intestine hallway be claustrophobic is great! It's an area designed to make you feel like something is wrong, it's a short area, and the ambush is fairly tame so there isn't much need to have a lot of freedom of movement.
- If there is a path where the player is required to take damage, give them some way to avoid that damage (rad suit, invuln, switch that disables the damage, etc.). You give the player an invuln on the way out, but not on the way in.
- Make sure secrets have some kind of indication they exist (slightly different texture, different lighting, framed by trim or items, etc.). This is optional if an area map is available somewhere that can show the player where it is.
- Textures in door tracks should be lower unpegged so they don't scroll when the door opens/closes.
- All the doors stay open permanently. Not necessarily a problem if that was intentional, but it was a curious observation and not what a player would normally expect.
- Inset doors into the wall a little bit. If they are flush with the wall, the whole wall above the door will scroll and the door will be visible while it is open.

## MAP02
- Nice starting area. Gives the player the shotgun early in case they're coming from a pistol start.
- Stacking items in groups or rows feels artificial. Scattered instances of higher quality pickups (stimpaks instead of health potions) can give the same amount and feel more natural.
- The gray box in the opening area can't be climbed onto from the center of the road. This can be a little jarring since all the other sides can be climbed up.
- Careful with having the player jump down a ledge into enemies. The enemies can end up blocking the player and there won't be much the player can do except wait for the enemies to move.
- Nice mix of lost souls! It adds a little spice to existing enemy variety without going too far.
- The intestine slime cracks are really cool, but it's not clear they would be damaging and it's inconsistent with the intestine area in the first map which wasn't.
- Barrels in the road feel weird. They block the path, but don't seem to serve a purpose either functionally or thematically.
- Big door is too wide. Make it thinner or use a wider texture.
- Use doortrak textures on inside of doors to separate them from the surrounding walls.
- Long line of health potions through the warehouse is suspicious. If that's intentional, great job! If not, maybe scatter them around the room or use fewer larger health items instead.
- Use a switch for giant doors. It feels weird for the player to manually move something so big.
- Warehouse area layout is interesting and easy to move through. Good job!
- Second half of warehouse is just a repeat of the first half which is a little disappointing. After moving through the first part, make the second part an evolution of it or an additional challenge.
- Love the apartment area and great use of ambush flags!
- Backpack secret requires key but there's no indication of that.
- Awesome job with the elevator! That was such a cool effect!
- Detailing on the floor in the sewers is awesome!
- If you have pass-through walls, make sure the ceiling is high enough that the texture doesn't clip into the ground
- Pass-through wall usage here (for a hidden shortcut between two areas) is great!
- Cacodemons in the sewers act really weird! It seems like they can't see the player?!
- Make sure the exit is marked either with exit signs or by using the exit door.
- If you use the exit door, have it be an actual door and open in a room where you can hit a switch. Don't make the door texture itself the exit switch. When the player sees the door they'll expect to open it and find a small room on the other side, and they may not be done exploring the map yet. If the door itself is the exit, the map will end before the player is ready.

## Other points not mentioned in video

- Pay attention to flat alignment. Mostly it was fine, but there were some areas where ceiling textures would cut off weirdly (like the lights in the first area of MAP02).
- Some minor texture alignment issues throughout, but nothing major. Pay particular attention along stairs.
- Being able to see out the hallway up the stairs in MAP02 is a really cool effect!
- Your maps are currently GZDoom specific, but don't seem to use any GZDoom-specific features. Using a more compatible format would allow players who don't prefer GZDoom-based ports to enjoy your levels as well!
